### Current Sprint Plan — QA Hardening, CMS Extensions, and Refactors

Scope: Harden QA (e2e + smoke), introduce CMS for Sponsors and Agenda, add admin test coverage, and begin component refactors per `NEXT_SPRINT_COMPONENT_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`. Keep changes incremental and reversible.

### 1) QA Hardening (completed for this sprint)

- Expand Playwright e2e to cover:
  - Public downloads return 200 (PDFs, ICS)
  - Anchors smooth-scroll to sections
  - `/request-access?type=…` renders expected labels
- Add GitHub Action for unit + e2e (matrix: chromium only to start)
- Align CI Playwright baseURL with `playwright.config.ts` web server:
  - Option A: set `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3100`
  - Option B: remove the env override so config default (3100) is used

Acceptance criteria

- e2e suite stable locally and in CI
- Fast smoke job for downloads and anchors
- CI uses a consistent baseURL with the Playwright web server

Implementation update (QA hardening branch)

- Target branch: `feature/qa-hardening-playwright-smoke` (to house these changes)
- Added Playwright mobile projects `mobile-chrome` and `mobile-safari` in `playwright.config.ts` to enable mobile smoke.
- Tagged `@smoke` on `e2e/home.spec.ts` for minimal cross-browser/mobile smoke.
- CI: added two jobs to avoid duplication and keep scope clear:
  - `e2e-smoke-desktop` (matrix: `chromium`, `webkit`) runs `--grep @smoke`.
  - `e2e-smoke-mobile` (matrix: `mobile-chrome`, `mobile-safari`) runs `--grep @smoke`.
- Kept existing Node-based `smoke` job (downloads/APIs) as complementary. Playwright smoke only covers page-level checks; no duplication.
- CI refined: removed interactive `drizzle-kit push`; rely on SQL fallback `drizzle/2025-08-20_add_sponsors.sql` and `scripts/seed-sponsors.mjs`. Next.js server builds/starts on :3100 and Playwright reuses it.

### Previous Sprint — Homepage MVP Finalization

Scope: Wire all homepage CTAs, replace broken anchors, add/download assets, and close hardcoded placeholders with minimal working paths. Keep changes incremental and reversible.

### 1) Fix anchors and CTA targets

- HeroSection
  - Change View Investment Opportunity href to `#investment-opportunity`
  - Retarget Executive Summary to `#financial-transparency` (or add an `id="executive-summary"` wrapper if preferred)

Acceptance criteria

- All listed buttons navigate without console errors or 404s
- Hero anchors resolve to real sections with smooth scroll
- No remaining broken `#` anchors on homepage

### 2) Public assets and docs

- Add OG/Twitter images used by `src/app/page.tsx`
  - `public/images/og-image.jpg`
  - `public/images/twitter-image.jpg`
- Create `public/docs/` and add these files (placeholders allowed initially):
  - `brochure.pdf`, `proposal.pdf`, `sponsorship-kit.pdf`, `financial-report.pdf`, `sponsor-deck.pdf`, `workshop-guide.pdf`, `schedule.pdf`, `technical-specs.pdf`
- Create `public/calendar/event.ics` for schedule (global event placeholder is fine for MVP)

Acceptance criteria

- All download links return 200 and download a file
- Social meta images exist and appear in local preview inspectors

### 3) Sponsors logos section

- Either provide real logos under `public/images/sponsors/…` for the listed brands or temporarily hide the grid until assets are ready
  - If assets not available this sprint, hide the logos block but leave sponsorship tiers visible
  - Decision (this sprint): Keep logos hidden. Leave tiers and CTA visible. Keep `SHOW_LOGOS = false` in `src/components/sections/SponsorsSection.tsx`.

Acceptance criteria

- No broken image requests in Network tab
- UI layout remains consistent when hidden
- Verified that the logos grid does not render (`SHOW_LOGOS` is false); tiers and CTA continue to render

### 4) Lead capture reuse

- Reuse existing `/request-access` for lead capture with `type` query param (notify, updates, speaker, sponsor, docs, demo, register, workshop)
- Add lightweight analytics events for clicks (optional nice-to-have)

Acceptance criteria

- Submitted forms land in current admin flow; no new backend required

### 5) Calendar and schedule

- Generate a basic static `event.ics` covering event dates; wire “Add to calendar” to the ICS
- Optionally add Google Calendar add URL (stretch)

Acceptance criteria

- ICS downloads and imports to Apple/Google Calendar successfully

### 6) Chat voice toggle (optional)

- Hide voice toggle until implemented, or implement Web Speech API basic start/stop

Acceptance criteria

- No misleading UI; if shown, mic button starts/stops recording and fills input

### 7) Data sanity pass

- Verify live financial data renders and BroadcastChannel triggers rerender
- Confirm speakers/artists lists load from `/api/*/public`

Acceptance criteria

- No fallback placeholders when API returns data
- No client/hydration warnings in console

### 8) QA checklist

- Run grep for missing anchors and 404 assets
- Click-through every CTA on homepage
- Lighthouse quick pass for obvious regressions

### Estimation and sequencing (small, incremental edits)

1. Anchors + CTA wiring (1 dev-day)
2. Docs + ICS placeholders (0.5 dev-day)
3. Sponsors logos or hide (0.5 dev-day)
4. Lead capture param mapping + analytics (0.5 dev-day)
5. Optional voice toggle handling (0.5 dev-day)
6. QA pass (0.5 dev-day)

### Out of scope (this sprint)

- Dynamic calendar per-session ICS
- Fully dynamic sponsor logos CMS
- Advanced chat voice transcription pipeline

### Deferred (scheduled for next sprint)

- Knowledge Overlay CMS (Neon CRUD for chat knowledge overlays)
  - See `NEXT_SPRINT_PLAN.md` → Section "4) Knowledge Overlay CMS (Phase 2 — Neon CRUD for chat knowledge)"
  - Includes DB overlay JSON, admin API + UI, loader TTL cache, and tests

### Backlog (post-sprint)

- Sponsors CMS: Add `sponsors` table (DB), `/api/admin/sponsors` (CRUD), admin page at `src/app/admin/sponsors/page.tsx` with upload flow, optional `/api/sponsors/public` feed, and wire `SponsorsSection.tsx` to fetch. Enable logos later by uploading assets to `public/images/sponsors/*` and flipping `SHOW_LOGOS` to true.

### Comprehensive Sprint Execution Plan

This plan is maintained in `CURRENT_SPRINT_PLAN.md`, organized into clear workstreams, tasks, and acceptance criteria, aligning to your preference for small, sequenced wins.

### Sprint Goal

Ship Homepage MVP finalization: wire all CTAs/anchors, add/download public assets, handle sponsors logos visibility, reuse lead-capture flow, provide static ICS, sanity-check data, and QA pass.

### Success Metrics

- 0 broken anchors/404s on homepage.
- All download links return 200.
- Smooth scroll to in-page anchors.
- Lead capture routes to `/request-access` with `type` param and current admin flow.
- No broken images in Network tab.
- Quick Lighthouse pass with no regressions.

### Timeline (5 focused days)

- Day 1: CTA + anchors, create IDs, ensure smooth scroll.
- Day 2: Public docs, OG/Twitter images, ICS file.
- Day 3: Sponsors logos handling + lead capture query param mapping.
- Day 4: Hide chat voice toggle if needed, data sanity checks.
- Day 5: QA sweep, Lighthouse, fix stragglers, final pass.

  - `src/app/api/financial/public/route.ts`

Acceptance criteria

- [x] No fallback placeholders when API returns data.
- [x] No client/hydration warnings.

### QA Checklist

- [ ] Grep for missing anchors and `#` placeholders in `src/components/sections/*` and `src/app/page.tsx`
- [ ] Click-test every CTA on homepage
- [ ] Network tab: 0 broken requests
- [ ] Lighthouse quick pass: no obvious regressions
- [ ] Cross-browser smoke: Safari/Chrome
- [ ] Mobile viewport smoke (iPhone 12/SE)

### Risks & Mitigations

- Broken links or anchors: keep a local click-through checklist; add `aria-label`s for clarity.
- Asset not-found: ship placeholder PDFs/images to prevent 404s.
- Inconsistent lead-capture copy: centralize `type`→copy mapping in `src/app/request-access/page.tsx`.
- Smooth scroll behavior: ensure `scroll-behavior: smooth;` in `globals.css` or use `scrollIntoView` on hashchange.

### Rollback Plan

- Anchor and CTA changes are safe to revert file-by-file.
- Assets are additive; keep placeholders even if real assets not ready.
- Sponsors logos: keep conditional flag to toggle visibility quickly.

### PR & Branch Strategy

- Branch naming: `feature/homepage-cta-anchors`, `chore/public-assets-docs`, `feature/request-access-type`, `chore/sponsors-visibility`, `chore/ics-file`, `chore/qa-fixes`.
- Small PRs, each tied to one workstream with clear acceptance criteria.
- Include before/after screenshots and quick test notes in PR descriptions.

### Definition of Done

- Homepage has no `href="#"`, all CTAs work, all downloads work.
- ICS present and imports cleanly.
- Sponsors section shows logos or is neatly hidden.
- `/request-access?type=…` flows work; admin sees submissions.
- QA checklist passed; Lighthouse quick pass OK.

### Owners (suggested)

- Anchors/CTAs: FE
- Assets/ICS: FE
- Sponsors visibility: FE
- Lead capture + analytics: FE
- Data sanity: FE
- QA: FE + reviewer

### Minimal task breakdown (checklist)

- [ ] Wire all anchors and CTAs per sections above
- [ ] Add public docs and images; verify meta
- [ ] Add ICS; verify import
- [ ] Sponsors logos visibility handling
- [ ] Lead capture `type` param mapping + optional analytics events
- [ ] Data sanity checks + fixes
- [ ] QA sweep and fixes

Notes

- If helpful, proceed to create stub assets (`public/docs/*.pdf`, `public/calendar/event.ics`) and wire the first batch of anchors in the relevant section components next.
