### Next Sprint Plan — Homepage MVP Finalization

Scope: Wire all homepage CTAs, replace broken anchors, add/download assets, and close hardcoded placeholders with minimal working paths. Keep changes incremental and reversible.

### 1) Fix anchors and CTA targets

- HeroSection
  - Change View Investment Opportunity href to `#investment-opportunity`
  - Retarget Executive Summary to `#financial-transparency` (or add an `id="executive-summary"` wrapper if preferred)
  - Link Request Full Access to `/request-access`
- InvestmentOpportunitySection
  - SponsorshipTiers: Link Become a Sponsor to `/request-access?type=sponsor`
  - DocumentsSection: Bottom CTA “Request Complete Documentation Package” to `/request-access?type=docs` (keep existing mailto fallback)
- FinancialTransparencySection
  - Download Financial Report → `/docs/financial-report.pdf`
  - View Sponsor Deck → `/docs/sponsor-deck.pdf`
  - Benefits tab "Secure Sponsorship" → `/request-access?type=sponsor`
- FeaturesSection
  - Register Now → `/request-access?type=register`
  - Card "Learn more" → map to appropriate sections (e.g. `#technology-platform`, `#investment-opportunity`) — decide mapping and implement
- AboutSection
  - Download Brochure → `/docs/brochure.pdf`
- CulturalWorkshopsSection
  - Reserve Your Spot → `/request-access?type=workshop`
  - View Full Schedule → `#schedule`
  - Download Workshop Guide → `/docs/workshop-guide.pdf`
- ScheduleSection
  - Add to calendar → `/calendar/event.ics` (static ICS file)
  - Download Full Schedule → `/docs/schedule.pdf`
  - Get Notified → `/request-access?type=notify`
- SpeakersSection
  - Stay Updated → `/request-access?type=updates`
  - Become a Speaker → `/request-access?type=speaker`
- SponsorsSection
  - Secure Sponsorship (per tier) → `/request-access?type=sponsor`
  - Download Sponsorship Kit → `/docs/sponsorship-kit.pdf`
- TechnologyPlatformSection
  - Request Platform Demo → `/request-access?type=demo`
  - Download Technical Specs → `/docs/technical-specs.pdf`
- TradeContextSection
  - Explore Sponsorship → `/request-access?type=sponsor`
  - View Trade Statistics → add external credible source link (Destatis / TradingEconomics)

Acceptance criteria

- All listed buttons navigate without console errors or 404s
- Hero anchors resolve to real sections with smooth scroll
- No remaining broken `#` anchors on homepage

### 2) Public assets and docs

- Add OG/Twitter images used by `src/app/page.tsx`
  - `public/images/og-image.jpg`
  - `public/images/twitter-image.jpg`
- Create `public/docs/` and add these files (placeholders allowed initially):
  - `brochure.pdf`, `proposal.pdf`, `sponsorship-kit.pdf`, `financial-report.pdf`, `sponsor-deck.pdf`, `workshop-guide.pdf`, `schedule.pdf`, `technical-specs.pdf`
- Create `public/calendar/event.ics` for schedule (global event placeholder is fine for MVP)

Acceptance criteria

- All download links return 200 and download a file
- Social meta images exist and appear in local preview inspectors

### 3) Sponsors logos section

- Either provide real logos under `public/images/sponsors/…` for the listed brands or temporarily hide the grid until assets are ready
  - If assets not available this sprint, hide the logos block but leave sponsorship tiers visible
  - Decision (this sprint): Keep logos hidden. Leave tiers and CTA visible. Keep `SHOW_LOGOS = false` in `src/components/sections/SponsorsSection.tsx`.

Acceptance criteria

- No broken image requests in Network tab
- UI layout remains consistent when hidden
- Verified that the logos grid does not render (`SHOW_LOGOS` is false); tiers and CTA continue to render

### 4) Lead capture reuse

- Reuse existing `/request-access` for lead capture with `type` query param (notify, updates, speaker, sponsor, docs, demo, register, workshop)
- Add lightweight analytics events for clicks (optional nice-to-have)

Acceptance criteria

- Submitted forms land in current admin flow; no new backend required

### 5) Calendar and schedule

- Generate a basic static `event.ics` covering event dates; wire “Add to calendar” to the ICS
- Optionally add Google Calendar add URL (stretch)

Acceptance criteria

- ICS downloads and imports to Apple/Google Calendar successfully

### 6) Chat voice toggle (optional)

- Hide voice toggle until implemented, or implement Web Speech API basic start/stop

Acceptance criteria

- No misleading UI; if shown, mic button starts/stops recording and fills input

### 7) Data sanity pass

- Verify live financial data renders and BroadcastChannel triggers rerender
- Confirm speakers/artists lists load from `/api/*/public`

Acceptance criteria

- No fallback placeholders when API returns data
- No client/hydration warnings in console

### 8) QA checklist

- Run grep for missing anchors and 404 assets
- Click-through every CTA on homepage
- Lighthouse quick pass for obvious regressions

### Estimation and sequencing (small, incremental edits)

1. Anchors + CTA wiring (1 dev-day)
2. Docs + ICS placeholders (0.5 dev-day)
3. Sponsors logos or hide (0.5 dev-day)
4. Lead capture param mapping + analytics (0.5 dev-day)
5. Optional voice toggle handling (0.5 dev-day)
6. QA pass (0.5 dev-day)

### Out of scope (this sprint)

- Dynamic calendar per-session ICS
- Fully dynamic sponsor logos CMS
- Advanced chat voice transcription pipeline

### Backlog (post-sprint)

- Sponsors CMS: Add `sponsors` table (DB), `/api/admin/sponsors` (CRUD), admin page at `src/app/admin/sponsors/page.tsx` with upload flow, optional `/api/sponsors/public` feed, and wire `SponsorsSection.tsx` to fetch. Enable logos later by uploading assets to `public/images/sponsors/*` and flipping `SHOW_LOGOS` to true.

### Comprehensive Sprint Execution Plan

I’ll draft a comprehensive, incremental sprint plan based on `NEXT_SPRINT_PLAN.md`, organized into clear workstreams, tasks, and acceptance criteria, aligning to your preference for small, sequenced wins.

### Sprint Goal

Ship Homepage MVP finalization: wire all CTAs/anchors, add/download public assets, handle sponsors logos visibility, reuse lead-capture flow, provide static ICS, sanity-check data, and QA pass.

### Success Metrics

- 0 broken anchors/404s on homepage.
- All download links return 200.
- Smooth scroll to in-page anchors.
- Lead capture routes to `/request-access` with `type` param and current admin flow.
- No broken images in Network tab.
- Quick Lighthouse pass with no regressions.

### Timeline (5 focused days)

- Day 1: CTA + anchors, create IDs, ensure smooth scroll.
- Day 2: Public docs, OG/Twitter images, ICS file.
- Day 3: Sponsors logos handling + lead capture query param mapping.
- Day 4: Hide chat voice toggle if needed, data sanity checks.
- Day 5: QA sweep, Lighthouse, fix stragglers, final pass.

  - [ ] Fire click events via `src/lib/analytics/client.ts` to `/api/analytics/track/route.ts`
  - Event names: `cta_click`, `download_click`
  - Properties: `section`, `cta`, `href`, `type` (for request-access)

Acceptance criteria

- [x] Forms submit and appear in current admin flow; no backend changes needed.
- [ ] Events visible in logs/backend if enabled.

### Workstream 5: Calendar and schedule

- [x] Provide static `public/calendar/event.ics` with correct DTSTART/DTEND and a single summary/description placeholder.
- [ ] Validate import in Apple/Google Calendar.

  - `src/app/api/financial/public/route.ts`

Acceptance criteria

- [ ] No fallback placeholders when API returns data.
- [ ] No client/hydration warnings.

### QA Checklist

- [ ] Grep for missing anchors and `#` placeholders in `src/components/sections/*` and `src/app/page.tsx`
- [ ] Click-test every CTA on homepage
- [ ] Network tab: 0 broken requests
- [ ] Lighthouse quick pass: no obvious regressions
- [ ] Cross-browser smoke: Safari/Chrome
- [ ] Mobile viewport smoke (iPhone 12/SE)

### Risks & Mitigations

- Broken links or anchors: keep a local click-through checklist; add `aria-label`s for clarity.
- Asset not-found: ship placeholder PDFs/images to prevent 404s.
- Inconsistent lead-capture copy: centralize `type`→copy mapping in `src/app/request-access/page.tsx`.
- Smooth scroll behavior: ensure `scroll-behavior: smooth;` in `globals.css` or use `scrollIntoView` on hashchange.

### Rollback Plan

- Anchor and CTA changes are safe to revert file-by-file.
- Assets are additive; keep placeholders even if real assets not ready.
- Sponsors logos: keep conditional flag to toggle visibility quickly.

### PR & Branch Strategy

- Branch naming: `feature/homepage-cta-anchors`, `chore/public-assets-docs`, `feature/request-access-type`, `chore/sponsors-visibility`, `chore/ics-file`, `chore/qa-fixes`.
- Small PRs, each tied to one workstream with clear acceptance criteria.
- Include before/after screenshots and quick test notes in PR descriptions.

### Definition of Done

- Homepage has no `href="#"`, all CTAs work, all downloads work.
- ICS present and imports cleanly.
- Sponsors section shows logos or is neatly hidden.
- `/request-access?type=…` flows work; admin sees submissions.
- QA checklist passed; Lighthouse quick pass OK.

### Owners (suggested)

- Anchors/CTAs: FE
- Assets/ICS: FE
- Sponsors visibility: FE
- Lead capture + analytics: FE
- Data sanity: FE
- QA: FE + reviewer

### Minimal task breakdown (checklist)

- [ ] Wire all anchors and CTAs per sections above
- [ ] Add public docs and images; verify meta
- [ ] Add ICS; verify import
- [ ] Sponsors logos visibility handling
- [ ] Lead capture `type` param mapping + optional analytics events
- [ ] Data sanity checks + fixes
- [ ] QA sweep and fixes

Notes

- If helpful, proceed to create stub assets (`public/docs/*.pdf`, `public/calendar/event.ics`) and wire the first batch of anchors in the relevant section components next.

### Current Sprint Progress Update

- Anchors and CTA wiring: DONE across homepage sections. All primary CTAs now target valid sections or `/request-access` routes with `type` params.
- Document downloads: Migrated to DB-backed resolver URLs and centralized via typed helper.
  - Helper added: `PUBLIC_DOWNLOAD_KEY` and `getPublicDownloadUrl(key)` in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
  - Updated sections to use helper: `AboutSection`, `CulturalWorkshopsSection`, `TechnologyPlatformSection`, `FinancialTransparencySection`, `SponsorsSection`, `ScheduleSection`.
  - Resolver endpoint in use: `/api/documents/public/download/[key]` with fallbacks to `public/docs/*`.
- Schedule/ICS: "Add to calendar" wired to `public/calendar/event.ics` (present). Manual import validation pending.
- Lead capture reuse: `/request-access` accepts and renders by `type` (notify, updates, speaker, sponsor, docs, demo, register, workshop). Submission posts to existing API. DONE.
- Speakers/artists and financial data: Public APIs rendering; BroadcastChannel refresh verified. DONE.
- Sponsors logos: Kept hidden (`SHOW_LOGOS = false`); tiers and CTA visible. DONE.
- FeaturesSection: "Register Now" wired to `/request-access?type=register`; cards "Learn more" mapped to `#technology-platform`. DONE.
- TradeContextSection: Sponsorship CTA and Destatis link wired. DONE.

Outstanding items to close the sprint:

- Public asset placeholders: Verify all PDFs exist in `public/docs/` (brochure, proposal, sponsorship-kit, financial-report, sponsor-deck, workshop-guide, schedule, technical-specs). Add missing ones.
- Social meta images: Add `public/images/og-image.jpg` and `public/images/twitter-image.jpg` and verify preview. Update meta in `src/app/page.tsx` if necessary.
- Analytics (optional): Fire `cta_click` / `download_click` events via `src/lib/analytics/client.ts` to `/api/analytics/track`.
- QA pass: Full click-through, ensure all download links return 302→200, anchors smooth-scroll, Network tab shows 0 errors, Lighthouse quick pass, cross-browser sanity.
