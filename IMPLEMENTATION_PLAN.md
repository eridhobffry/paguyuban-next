# Paguyuban Messe 2026 - Implementation Plan & Project Archive

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Paguyuban Messe 2026 website project, serving as both a historical archive of completed work and a high-level roadmap for future development. The project follows YAGNI principles, prioritizing simple, effective solutions and incremental delivery.

### üöÄ CURRENT STATUS (As of Sprint 2 End)

The project has successfully completed several major phases, including critical data alignment, content enhancement, access control, and the implementation of a foundational Content Management System (CMS) for key data types. The most recent sprints have focused on wiring up all homepage calls-to-action, establishing a robust QA process with automated testing, and delivering a comprehensive suite of admin-focused tests.

The website is stable, feature-rich, and production-ready for its primary goal of sponsor outreach. Future work will focus on extending CMS capabilities and refactoring components for long-term maintainability.

## Completed Implementation Phases

This section archives the major completed phases and sprints of the project.

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Critical Data Alignment (Completed Aug 3, 2025)

This phase corrected all critical financial and sponsorship data on the website to align with internal documentation.

- **Financial Data:** Corrected total revenue from ‚Ç¨615,660 to **‚Ç¨1,018,660**.
- **Sponsorship Tiers:** Updated all pricing tiers to match official rates (e.g., Title Sponsor from ‚Ç¨75k to ‚Ç¨120k).
- **ROI Calculator:** Refactored to focus on sponsor benefits and value realization, supported by a credible methodology.

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Content Enhancement (Completed Aug 3, 2025)

This phase enriched the website with credible data and context to build trust with potential sponsors.

- **Trade Context:** Added section with ‚Ç¨7.32B bilateral trade data from official sources.
- **Audience Projections:** Updated to reflect 6,800+ total attendees (online and offline).
- **Strategic Sectors:** Detailed 6 key collaboration sectors with market potential data.

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Access Control & User Management (Completed Aug 4, 2025)

This phase secured the website and implemented a robust system for managing user access.

- **Authentication:** Implemented a full JWT-based authentication system.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Created a dashboard for approving, rejecting, revoking, restoring, and deleting users.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Introduced `super_admin`, `admin`, and `member` roles to protect critical actions.
- **Security:** Ensured secure password hashing (bcrypt), route protection via middleware, and transaction safety.

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Foundational CMS & Analytics (Completed Aug 11, 2025)

This phase migrated static site content into a dynamic, database-backed CMS and introduced analytics.

- **CMS Implemented For:**
  - **Financials:** Full CRUD for revenue/costs, with charts and optimistic UI updates.
  - **Speakers & Artists:** Full CRUD with image upload handling and public-facing APIs.
  - **Executive Documents:** Admin upload and management with Gemini-assisted field extraction.
- **Analytics (First Cut):** Deployed client-side tracking for key user interactions (page views, clicks, dwell time) and built an initial admin analytics dashboard.
- **Accessibility:** Implemented foundational accessibility features (skip links, landmarks, focus rings).

### ‚úÖ Sprint: Homepage MVP Finalization

This sprint focused on making the public-facing homepage fully interactive and functional.

- **CTA & Anchor Wiring:** All call-to-action buttons and anchor links on the homepage were wired to their correct destinations (`/request-access?type=...`, section IDs, etc.).
- **Public Assets:** All required public documents (PDFs), images (OG/Twitter), and a static calendar event (`.ics`) were created and linked.
- **Lead Capture:** The `/request-access` page was enhanced to handle different lead types based on a URL query parameter, streamlining the lead flow into the existing admin dashboard.

### ‚úÖ Sprint: Admin Test Coverage & QA Hardening

This sprint significantly increased the quality and stability of the admin panel and the project as a whole.

- **QA Hardening:** Expanded Playwright E2E test suite to cover downloads, anchor scrolling, and lead capture forms. Established CI jobs for automated desktop and mobile smoke tests.
- **Admin Schema Tests:** Added 42 unit tests to validate Zod schemas for all admin data types.
- **Admin API Route Tests:** Added 25 tests to secure and validate all admin API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), covering authentication, authorization, and error handling.
- **Admin Form Tests:** Wrote 28 tests for the Sponsor creation/edit form, ensuring UI validation and form submission workflows are robust.

## Project Backlog & Future Work

This section outlines the remaining high-priority features and initiatives planned for future sprints.

### ‚è≥ CMS Feature Extensions

- **Knowledge Overlay CMS:** The highest priority next feature. This will allow admins to dynamically update the knowledge base for the on-site chatbot via a JSON editor in the admin panel, without requiring a redeployment.
- **Agenda CMS:** Implement admin CRUD for the event agenda (days, sessions, speaker assignments).
- **Sponsors CMS (Phase 2):** While a basic CMS exists, the next phase involves adding a logo upload flow and fully wiring it to the public-facing `SponsorsSection`.
- **Investment Opportunity CMS:** Migrate the static "Investment Opportunity" section to be database-driven.

### ‚è≥ Technical Debt & Refactoring

- **Component Refactoring:** A large number of frontend components (especially in the admin panel and homepage sections) have grown too large. A comprehensive refactoring plan is documented in `NEXT_SPRINT_COMPONENT_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` and is slated to begin in the next sprint.
- **Advanced Admin Features:** Future enhancements include rich text editors, content preview functionality, and data export capabilities.

### ‚è≥ Analytics & Reporting V2

- **Scheduled Reporting:** Implement a cron job to sessionize analytics data and surface higher-level insights (e.g., engagement trends, conversion funnels).
- **Admin Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a full QA pass on the admin panel for accessibility issues (contrast, labels, keyboard navigation).

## Technical Implementation Notes (Historical)

- **File Organization:** The project follows a standard Next.js structure with clear separation for API routes (`/api`), UI components (`/components`), libraries (`/lib`), and database logic (`/db`).
- **Authentication:** JWTs are stored in HTTP-only cookies with a 7-day expiration. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
- **Database:** The project uses PostgreSQL via Neon with Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries.
- **Testing:** The testing stack includes Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E tests.
