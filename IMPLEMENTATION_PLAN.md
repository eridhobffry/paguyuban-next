## 🚀 Sprint 3 Plan — CMS Extensions & Component Refactoring

### Overview

**Sprint Goal:** Extend CMS capabilities and begin component refactoring to improve maintainability.  
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks | **Priority:** High-impact features for admin capabilities and code quality.

### Sprint Objectives

#### 1) AI Platform Migration (Replace Gemini with Local) — Highest Priority

**Goal:** Eliminate external AI costs by removing Gemini usage and switching to a local AI runtime.

**Implementation:**

- **Client Replacement:** Replace `src/lib/ai/gemini-client.ts` with a local AI client. Keep the same interface (`generateText`, `extractJsonObject`) for a drop-in swap.
- **Routing & Services:** Update all routes/services that currently import Gemini client (e.g., `admin/analytics/chat/recommend`, `admin/partnership/recommend`, `analytics/chat/summary`, `src/lib/document-analyzer.ts`, `src/lib/gemini.ts`) to use the local client.
- **Models & Runtime:** Use the local AI runner under `ai/` directory (`@/ai`). Configure a lightweight local model and ensure deterministic JSON output for schema validation.
- **Validation:** Keep Zod-based validation pipelines intact. Ensure JSON-mode outputs integrate with existing schemas in `src/lib/ai/schemas.ts`.
- **Config & Secrets:** Remove Gemini API key dependencies from `.env*` and CI. Add toggles to switch providers if needed.
- **Testing:** Update unit/integration tests to run against local AI. Mock interfaces where appropriate to keep tests fast and deterministic.
- **Docs:** Document migration in `docs/GEMINI_USAGE.md` (deprecation notes), and update CI notes to reflect local inference usage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- No external Gemini calls are made in any environment
- All existing tests pass against the local AI client
- Cost for AI usage reduced to zero in development and CI
- Feature parity for existing AI features (intent detection, summaries, recommendations)

#### 2) Knowledge Overlay CMS (High Priority)

**Goal:** Allow admins to dynamically update chatbot knowledge without redeployment.

**Implementation:**

- **Database & Migration:** Define DB schema and create migration (`drizzle/`, Neon) for a `knowledge` table storing overlay JSON and metadata.
- **CRUD API Routes:** Implement admin-protected, Zod-validated routes: `GET /api/admin/knowledge`, `PUT /api/admin/knowledge`, and upload support if needed.
- **Admin UI:** Build forms with `react-hook-form` + Zod, including a JSON editor, validation, and previews for key paths (e.g., `event.dates`, `financials.revenue.total`).
- **Loader Integration:** Implement precedence and merge logic in `src/lib/knowledge/loader.ts` to combine static, file, and DB overlays via deep merge and short TTL cache.
- **Testing:** Add unit tests and E2E tests covering CRUD flows, loader behavior, and chat consumption of overlays.
- **Docs & Plans:** Update `CURRENT_SPRINT_PLAN.md`, `NEXT_SPRINT_PLAN.md`, and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to reflect the Knowledge Overlay CMS.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admin can edit overlay JSON and save to database
- Chat uses updated knowledge within TTL without redeployment
- All tests pass including chat integration

#### 3) Agenda CMS MVP

**Goal:** Enable admin management of event agenda with speaker assignments.

**Implementation:**

- **Database:** Use existing tables: `agenda_days`, `sessions`, `session_speakers`
- **Admin CRUD:** Create admin interface for days and sessions management
- **Speaker Linking:** Manage speaker assignments via `session_speakers` table
- **Public API:** `/api/agenda/public` endpoint
- **Feature Flag:** Behind flag until fully tested

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admin can create/edit/delete agenda items and speaker assignments
- Public API returns properly formatted agenda data
- Feature flag controls visibility

#### 4) Sponsors CMS

**Goal:** Complete dynamic sponsor logo management system.

**Implementation:**

- **Database:** `sponsors` table with name, tier, logoUrl, link
- **Admin CRUD:** Full page under `src/app/admin/sponsors/page.tsx`
- **Public API:** `/api/sponsors/public` endpoint
- **File Upload:** Logo upload with proper validation
- **Integration:** Wire `SponsorsSection.tsx` to use dynamic data

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admin can upload/manage sponsor logos
- Public section displays logos when enabled
- No broken image requests
- Proper fallback handling

#### 5) Component Refactoring (Start)

**Goal:** Break down oversized components to improve maintainability.

**Implementation:**

- **Priority Components:** Start with `src/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` (696 LOC)
- **Split Strategy:** Extract into `AnalyticsHeader`, `KpiCards`, `TrendsChart`, `BreakdownTables`, `RecommendationsPanel`, `SummariesPanel`
- **Data Layer:** Move data derivations to `src/hooks/useAdminData.ts`
- **Pattern:** Follow established component organization patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- No runtime behavior changes
- All lint and typecheck pass
- Components ≤ 200 LOC where practical
- Clear separation of concerns
