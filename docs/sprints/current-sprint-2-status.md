## Next Steps After Sprint 2 Completion

### Immediate Actions

1. **Execute Manual QA Tests** - Complete the remaining 5% of Sprint 2
2. **Merge Sprint Branch** - Merge `sprint-2-admin-tests` into main branch
3. **Deploy to Production** - Release enhanced admin functionality with comprehensive test coverage

### Post-Sprint Planning

1. **Sprint 3 Preparation** - Plan next sprint focusing on:

   - Knowledge Overlay CMS implementation
   - Component refactoring (admin analytics page, document upload)
   - Agenda CMS MVP development
   - Advanced admin features

2. **Technical Debt Reduction** - Begin addressing the component refactoring backlog documented in `NEXT_SPRINT_COMPONENT_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`

## ðŸ“ˆ Sprint 2 Impact

This sprint has significantly improved the project's quality foundation:

- **Reliability**: 67+ automated tests ensure admin functionality works as expected
- **Security**: Comprehensive validation prevents common vulnerabilities
- **Maintainability**: Clear test structure makes future development safer
- **User Experience**: Enhanced QA process catches issues before they reach production

**Sprint 2 will be complete once the manual QA pass is finished and all tests pass.**
